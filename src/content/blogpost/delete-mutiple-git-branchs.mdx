I sometimes (always) forget to delete my local branchs and someday
I type `git branch` to find a branch and I ended up scrolling through a huge list.

If I have a few branches to delete I can easily type each name separated by spaces to delete them:

```shell
git branch -D branch1 branch2 branch2
```

But at some point is annoying to type one by one so I discovered a way to delete multiple branchs when they share a name pattern.

We can delete the result list of a `git branch --list` command ðŸ¤¯

```shell
git branch -D `git branch --list 'PREFIX*'`
```

Inside the single quotes we can use any type of prefix or postfix

### Example

After I'm done with the feature branches I usually deleting them by deleting all branchs with a `feat/` prefix.

```shell
# show local branchs
> git branch

# local branchs
  main*
  feat/navbar
  feat/button
  feat/header
  fix/download

# delete all branchs with the 'feat/*'
> git branch -D `git branch --list 'feat/*'`

# check the list again
> git branch

# all feature branchs are deleted
  main*
  fix/download
```
