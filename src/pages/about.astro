Hi! I'm Salatiel Queiroz. My professional journey begins as a graphic designer 8 years ago then after learning HTML/CSS
and a little PHP I started designing and developing WordPress themes. After working as a UI designer for almost 5 years
and coding as a hobby. I decided to dive deep to become a front-end developer. Now I build software with Javscript ðŸ’›
